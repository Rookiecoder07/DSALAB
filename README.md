Each file contains the entire implementation of a single experiment.

🧪 List of All 25 Experiments

Below is a list of all experiments with a short explanation:

1️⃣ Insert & Delete in 1-D Array

Insertion and deletion at a specific position using element shifting.

2️⃣ Reverse an Array

Reversing an array by swapping symmetric elements.

3️⃣ Addition & Multiplication of 2-D Arrays

Matrix addition and standard matrix multiplication.

4️⃣ Find Maximum & Minimum in Array

Sequential search to find largest and smallest elements.

5️⃣ Factorial (Iterative + Recursive)

Understanding recursion vs iteration with factorial logic.

6️⃣ Fibonacci Series (Iterative + Recursive)

Generate Fibonacci numbers using both approaches.

7️⃣ Tower of Hanoi

Classic divide-and-conquer recursion problem.

8️⃣ Print Numbers from N to 1 (Recursion)

Simple recursion to print in reverse order.

9️⃣ Linear Search in 2-D Matrix

Search for an element row-wise and column-wise.

🔟 Binary Search in Sorted Array

Efficient searching using divide-and-conquer.

1️⃣1️⃣ First & Last Occurrence in Sorted Array

Modified binary search to find the range of duplicates.

1️⃣2️⃣ Bubble Sort

Swapping-based sorting algorithm.

1️⃣3️⃣ Selection Sort

Finding the minimum and placing it in order.

1️⃣4️⃣ Quick Sort

Partition-based divide-and-conquer sort.

1️⃣5️⃣ Quick Sort (Example 2)

Another dataset for practice.

1️⃣6️⃣ Merge Sort

Recursive sorting by splitting and merging.

1️⃣7️⃣ Singly Linked List (Menu-Driven)

Insert, delete, search, and display operations.

1️⃣8️⃣ Doubly Linked List

Nodes with previous and next pointers.

1️⃣9️⃣ Circular Linked List

Singly linked list where the last node connects to the first.

2️⃣0️⃣ Stack Using Array

Push, pop, isEmpty, isFull operations.

2️⃣1️⃣ Circular Queue Using Array

Efficient queue using modular arithmetic.

2️⃣2️⃣ Binary Tree Traversals

In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal.

2️⃣3️⃣ Binary Search Tree (BST)

Insert, delete, and search operations implemented.

2️⃣4️⃣ BFS (Level Order Traversal)

Traversal using queue (Breadth-First Search).

2️⃣5️⃣ DFS (Depth First Traversal)

Recursive traversal of tree nodes.
